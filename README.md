# Healthpack - a medication tracker and reminder

## Overview

This application inhabits a smart medicine cabinet which you program
with your dose requirements.   It remembers when you last took a dose,
and reminds you when time for next dose is approaching

For those, like me, who sometimes have hectic mornings where they're not sure if they took
their dose today or not, there's a visual reminder whether or not a
dose was taken recently.
